Case Study:  BAC Structured Notes
"Changing Support Models – BAC/ML merger moves the Equity Linked Notes (ELN) business to a Treasury-based Support Model
Notes issuance booked in Summit (Treasury v. investors) with hedges booked in multiple Global Markets systems (Vmaster, eBlotter, Vienna, Orca, Sierra, and Altair)
Global Markets (i.e. GELP) trade bookings in RAM (Street-facing and Treasury-facing legs)
Difficult to get a centralized view of risk and PnL for the SN business"
